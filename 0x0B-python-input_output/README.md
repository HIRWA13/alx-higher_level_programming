# Python Files

## in this repository I learned how:

1. files are the major storage units in a computer

2. and I learned also how we can interact with files by using python with the help of 
some file methods such as read(), readline(), readlines() and many more.

3. I have learned also how to append(add content) at the end of a textfile

4. I have learned how to use the write method that overwrites all the contents
that are present in a text file
5. I have also learned what and how to use the JSON(Javascript Object Notation) 
which helps us to return objects in a sttring notation
